                <h3>Order on the Go â€“ Food Ordering Web Application</h3>
                <p>Developed a MERN stack-based food ordering web app with user authentication, category browsing, cart
management, and secure checkout. Implemented an admin dashboard for managing restaurants, menu items, and
orders with a responsive, user-friendly UI.                                                                               </p>

                <h3>Driver Drowsiness Detection using Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>This project implements a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes facial features such as eye and mouth movements to detect signs of fatigue, including closed eyes or yawning. By leveraging models like SVM trained on labeled datasets, the system provides timely alerts to prevent accidents, enhancing road safety. It integrates webcam input, feature extraction, and real-time prediction to deliver an efficient and practical fatigue monitoring solution.                                                                             </p>
